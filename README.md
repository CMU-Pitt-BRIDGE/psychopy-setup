Setting Folder Permissions for pyenv:
Locate the pyenv Installation Directory: If you've installed pyenv system-wide, it might be in a directory like C:\pyenv.

Open Windows File Explorer: Navigate to the directory where pyenv is installed.

Access Properties: Right-click on the pyenv folder and select 'Properties'.

Security Tab: Go to the 'Security' tab. Here you will see a list of user accounts and groups along with their permissions.

Edit Permissions: Click the 'Edit' button to modify permissions. You need to ensure that users who need to access pyenv have at least 'Read & execute', 'List folder contents', and 'Read' permissions. If it's a shared machine and all users need access, consider adding 'Full control' for the 'Users' group.

Apply Changes: After setting the permissions, click 'Apply' and then 'OK'.

Setting Folder Permissions for Poetry:
The process for setting folder permissions for Poetry is similar. You would typically find the Poetry installation in a path like C:\ProgramData\Poetry if installed system-wide.

Navigate to the Poetry Directory: Go to the Poetry installation directory in Windows File Explorer.

Properties and Security: Just like with pyenv, right-click on the folder, select 'Properties', and go to the 'Security' tab.

Modify and Apply: Adjust the permissions as needed so that all intended users have at least 'Read & execute', 'List folder contents', and 'Read' permissions. Apply the changes.

Additional Tips:
Administrative Access: Remember, changing permissions in system directories typically requires administrative privileges. Make sure you have the necessary rights to make these changes.

Propagation of Permissions: When changing permissions, ensure that they are set to be inherited by subdirectories and files within the pyenv and Poetry folders. This ensures consistency across the entire installation.

Group Policy Considerations: In a managed IT environment, permissions might be controlled by Group Policy. If you are unable to change permissions, or if they revert after being set, consult your IT department.

Testing: After setting permissions, it's a good idea to log in as a non-administrative user (if you're not already) and test whether pyenv and Poetry function as expected.
